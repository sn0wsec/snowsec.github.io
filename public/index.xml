      <description>Strela Stealer I decided to grab a random malware sample from any.run and have a bit of a poke around. The file I chose from public submissions has the following details:
MD5: 09a3293c8e85921340f2e75cf398b0a5 FileName: 2585747226036.zip Extracted FileName: 2585747226036.js This file showed as no threats detected in the sandbox. Despite it showing no malicious activity (note the .dll error message box below which may be a deception technique or a legitimate error), a quick look at the AnyRun process tree shows some interesting things; we’ll keep this in mind for our analysis.</description>

      <title>HTB - SpookyLicense [reversing]</title>

      <description>Introduction SpookyLicense is an “easy” reverse engineering challenge offered by HackTheBox, with “easy” in quotes as this one took me a considerable amount of effort. I am fairly new to reversing challenges and reverse engineering in general, but that’s what these are all about—learning new things. This was just my experience and there may be—as they say—more than one way to crack an egg. With all that being said, this is how I managed to solve the challenge.</description>

      <title>HTB - Pandora&#39;s Bane [forensics]</title>

      <description>Introduction This was the final Forensics category challenge in HackTheBox&amp;rsquo;s recent CTF, Cyber Apocalypse — The Cursed Mission.
My notes won&amp;rsquo;t be super detailed here as I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a whole lot of documentation during the CTF, so this is more just snippets of methodologies applied. This one felt like a speedrun compared to how much time I spent getting stuck on the final decryption of Interstellar C2 (which I could not do, btw).</description>
